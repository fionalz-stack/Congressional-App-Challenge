# Dark Mode Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Transit app with comprehensive dark mode support, building upon the existing DarkModeContext to provide a seamless and accessible dark theme experience. The implementation will integrate with the existing Gluestack UI components while maintaining the app's white/purple color scheme aesthetic in both light and dark modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dark Mode Theme Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to support both light and dark themes that automatically adapt to my system preferences, so that I can use the app comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL detect the user's system color scheme preference
2. WHEN the system color scheme changes THEN the app SHALL automatically update to match unless user has manually overridden
3. WHEN no manual preference is set THEN the system SHALL follow the device's system theme setting
4. IF the user has previously set a manual preference THEN the system SHALL use that preference instead of system settings

### Requirement 2: Manual Dark Mode Toggle

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually toggle between light and dark modes regardless of my system settings, so that I can choose my preferred appearance for the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the settings or profile screen THEN the system SHALL display a dark mode toggle control
2. WHEN I toggle the dark mode setting THEN the app SHALL immediately switch themes without requiring a restart
3. WHEN I set a manual preference THEN the system SHALL persist this choice across app sessions
4. WHEN I toggle dark mode THEN the system SHALL provide smooth visual transitions between themes

### Requirement 3: White/Purple Themed Dark Mode Colors

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark mode to maintain the app's white/purple color scheme with appropriate dark variants, so that the app feels consistent with the existing brand aesthetic even in dark mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL use dark backgrounds with purple accent colors that complement the existing white/purple theme
2. WHEN displaying text in dark mode THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility (minimum 4.5:1)
3. WHEN showing purple-themed elements THEN the system SHALL adapt purple shades appropriately for dark backgrounds while maintaining brand recognition
4. WHEN displaying interactive elements THEN the system SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and brand consistency using dark variants of the white/purple color palette

### Requirement 4: Gluestack UI Component Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Gluestack UI components to automatically respect the dark mode theme, so that the entire app interface is consistent without manual theme management per component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all Gluestack UI components SHALL automatically use dark theme variants
2. WHEN switching themes THEN custom components SHALL seamlessly adapt their styling to match the white/purple color scheme
3. WHEN using themed components THEN the system SHALL provide proper TypeScript support for theme-aware styling
4. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL use the centralized theme configuration without individual theme props

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a user with visual accessibility needs, I want the dark mode implementation to meet accessibility standards and provide clear visual feedback, so that I can use the app effectively regardless of my visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all text SHALL meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. WHEN interactive elements are displayed THEN they SHALL have sufficient contrast and clear focus indicators in both themes
3. WHEN theme transitions occur THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations that don't cause accessibility issues
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN theme changes SHALL be announced appropriately to assistive technologies

### Requirement 6: Icon Visibility and Contrast

**User Story:** As a user, I want all icons throughout the app to be clearly visible and properly contrasted in dark mode, so that I can easily identify and interact with all interface elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all icons within page content SHALL use colors that provide sufficient contrast against dark backgrounds
2. WHEN viewing route cards THEN status icons, timing icons, and action icons SHALL be clearly visible in dark mode
3. WHEN interacting with buttons and controls THEN icon colors SHALL adapt appropriately to maintain visual hierarchy
4. WHEN icons are used for informational purposes THEN they SHALL maintain their semantic meaning while being visible in dark mode
5. WHEN icons appear in different contexts THEN they SHALL consistently use appropriate dark mode color variants

### Requirement 7: Performance and State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want dark mode switching to be instant and not impact app performance, so that I can toggle themes without experiencing delays or interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN toggling dark mode THEN the theme change SHALL complete within 200ms
2. WHEN the app starts THEN theme initialization SHALL not delay the app launch
3. WHEN switching themes THEN the system SHALL not cause unnecessary re-renders of unaffected components
4. WHEN persisting theme preferences THEN the system SHALL handle storage errors gracefully without affecting app functionality
