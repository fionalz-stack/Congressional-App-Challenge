# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CNMI Transit App is a modern, island-smart mobile application designed to make public transit simple, reliable, and welcoming for both residents and visitors in Saipan and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The app combines real-time bus tracking, rider check-in functionality to prevent missed pickups, accessible design principles, and a distinctly CNMI-forward aesthetic featuring ocean/reef color palettes and latte-stone iconography, along with curated visitor guidance.
